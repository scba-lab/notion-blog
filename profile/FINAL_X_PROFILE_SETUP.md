## 🎯 Your First Week Content Plan

### Monday (Day 1):
**Intro Post**
```
Hey X! 👋 Supply chain professional who codes here.
Sharing my journey of building AI solutions for operations.
First post: How I built a blog in 3 hours. Coming soon! 🚀
```

### Tuesday (Day 2):
**Main Thread**
Post your 9-tweet thread about building the blog

### Wednesday (Day 3):
**Supply Chain Insight**
```
In supply chain, we minimize touchpoints.
Every transfer = cost + risk.

Applied this to my blog:
Notion → API → Deploy

One tool. Zero friction.

Supply chain thinking works everywhere. 🔄
```

### Thursday (Day 4):
**Technical Tip**
```
Just learned: Next.js ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

Updates every 60 seconds without redeployment.

Perfect for content that changes but doesn't need real-time updates.

One line of code:
export const revalidate = 60;

Game changer. ⚡
```

### Friday (Day 5):
**Career/Personal**
```
Working across Korea, Germany, and Spain taught me:

🇰🇷 Speed matters
🇩🇪 Precision matters
🇪🇸 Balance matters

Now I build: Fast, precise, sustainable.

Your environment shapes your approach. Choose wisely.
```

### Weekend:
Engage with others, no posting
