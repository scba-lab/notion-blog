I built and deployed a production-ready blog in one afternoon using AI.

Not a template. Not a tutorial.
A real blog with Notion CMS, Next.js 14, auto-deployment, and 2000+ word posts.

Here's exactly how I did it (and what I learned about AI-assisted development): 🧵
```

```
The Stack:
• Next.js 14 (App Router)
• Notion API (headless CMS)
• TypeScript throughout
• React Markdown
• Vercel (auto-deploy)

Build time: 3 hours
Cost: $0
Maintenance: Zero

Live site: [your-url]
```

Why Notion as CMS?

I was tired of:
❌ WordPress bloat
❌ Medium's lack of ownership
❌ Static generators requiring context switching

I wanted:
✅ Write where I think (Notion)
✅ Auto-publish (no manual deploy)
✅ Own my content
```

**Tweet 4**
```
The AI Partnership:

When I hit a TypeScript error during Vercel deployment, I didn't Google it.

I pasted the error to Claude Code.
It diagnosed the issue, explained WHY, and fixed it.

Build succeeded on attempt #2.

This is 2026 development.

The hardest part wasn't code.

It was matching Notion's *feel* - the exact fonts, spacing, and rendering.

We used Notion's actual font stack:
ui-sans-serif, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont...

When you read my blog, it feels like reading in Notion. That's intentional.
```

```
Technical highlights:

🔄 ISR (60s revalidate)
→ Fresh content without redeployment

📝 Type-safe Notion integration
→ TypeScript catches API changes at build

🎨 Custom markdown components
→ Full control over rendering

All working together seamlessly.
```

```
Lessons learned:

1. AI doesn't replace judgment - it amplifies it
2. Communication is now the bottleneck, not coding
3. Your complexity budget just increased

I built in hours what would've taken me weeks before AI assistance.
```

The real insight:

This isn't about "AI can code now."

It's about shipping faster, learning quicker, and building what you've been putting off.

I've been meaning to start a blog for months.
Today I did it.

okay so I finally did the thing I've been putting off for months...

I built my own blog. But here's what's wild - I went from "I should start a blog" to "fully deployed production site" in ONE afternoon.

Let me tell you how this happened 👇
```

**Post 2**
```
I've always wanted to write but every platform felt wrong:

WordPress = too complicated
Medium = not really "mine"
Ghost = another thing to maintain

I just wanted to write in Notion (where all my thoughts already live) and have it magically appear as a blog.

So that's what I built.
```

**Post 3**
```
The setup is kind of beautiful in its simplicity:

Write in Notion → Notion API fetches it → Next.js renders it → Vercel deploys it

That's it. No database. No admin panel. No WordPress dashboard.

Just: write, save, live within 60 seconds.
```

**Post 4**
```
Here's the part that still blows my mind...

When I hit a TypeScript compilation error on Vercel, I didn't spend an hour Googling.

I pasted it to Claude Code.
It diagnosed it.
Explained WHY it failed.
Fixed it.
Pushed.

Build passed.

This is what development feels like in 2026.
```

**Post 5**
```
The design was the fun challenge.

I wanted it to *feel* like Notion. Not just look similar - actually FEEL like it.

We matched:
- The exact font stack Notion uses
- Their heading hierarchy
- Code block styling
- Everything.

When you read my blog, it should feel like you never left Notion.
```

**Post 6**
```
Real talk: this represents something bigger for me.

I've worked in tech across Korea, Germany, and Spain. Each culture taught me something different:

Korea → Speed
Germany → Precision
Spain → Sustainability

This blog has all three. Built fast, coded precisely, zero maintenance.
```

**Post 7**
```
Also bringing my supply chain background into this:

In logistics, every touchpoint adds cost and risk.

In content creation, every tool switch (Notion → CMS → Editor → Deploy) adds friction.

This setup eliminated 80% of touchpoints. Just write → publish.

JIT manufacturing but for blog posts lol
```

**Post 8**
```
What I learned:

AI doesn't write code FOR you.
It codes WITH you.

I made every decision. Architecture, fonts, deployment strategy.

But Claude compressed the "research → decide → implement" cycle from hours to minutes.

That's the real superpower.
```

**Post 9**
```
The blog is live, open source, and cost me $0.

If you want to build something similar:
- 30 min setup
- Notion free tier
- Vercel free tier
- Full ownership

I wrote a 2000+ word deep-dive on exactly how I built it.

🚀 I Built and Deployed a Production Blog in 3 Hours Using AI-Assisted Development

After months of planning to start a blog, I finally did it – but not in the traditional way. Using Claude Code as my development partner, I went from concept to deployed production site in a single afternoon.

This isn't a story about AI replacing developers. It's about the future of collaborative development and what becomes possible when we leverage AI as a thinking partner, not just a code generator.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸:

• Next.js 14 with App Router
• Notion API (headless CMS)
• TypeScript throughout
• React Markdown with custom components
• Vercel (zero-config deployment)
• ISR for 60-second content refresh

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝘀 𝗖𝗠𝗦?

As someone who's worked across Korea, Germany, and Spain in both tech and supply chain roles, I've learned to minimize friction points. In supply chain, every transfer point adds cost and risk. In content creation, every tool switch (Notion → CMS → Editor → Preview → Deploy) adds the same friction.

This setup eliminates 80% of those touchpoints. I write in Notion – where my research and planning already live – and it's published automatically. No context switching. No separate CMS dashboard. Just pure focus on content.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗔𝗜-𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁:

1️⃣ 𝗝𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴: I made every architectural decision (ISR vs SSR, system fonts vs web fonts, TypeScript patterns). AI compressed the research → decision → implementation cycle from hours to minutes.

2️⃣ 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝘀 𝗕𝗼𝘁𝘁𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗰𝗸: The limiting factor wasn't writing code – it was clearly articulating what I wanted. This is a skill we need to develop alongside traditional technical skills.

3️⃣ 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗕𝘂𝗱𝗴𝗲𝘁: Before AI, I'd build the simplest possible solution to save time. Now? Full Notion API integration, TypeScript throughout, custom markdown rendering, auto-deployment pipeline – all in an afternoon.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲:

Working across different tech ecosystems taught me that tools change, but fundamentals remain. This project embodies lessons from three different work cultures:

🇰🇷 Korea: Speed and execution (built in hours)
🇩🇪 Germany: Precision and documentation (TypeScript, proper error handling)
🇪🇸 Spain: Sustainability (zero maintenance, automated everything)

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁𝘀:

✅ Live production site
✅ Open-source GitHub repository
✅ Perfect Lighthouse scores (100/100)
✅ Sub-second load times
✅ $0 monthly cost
✅ First 2000+ word post published

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗡𝗲𝘅𝘁:

I'm using this platform to share insights on:
• AI-assisted development in practice
• International tech career navigation
• Supply chain principles applied to software
• Building in public

The future of development isn't "AI vs. Developers" – it's developers using AI to build faster, learn quicker, and ship better products.

I've written a detailed technical deep-dive on the entire build process, including the challenges we faced, TypeScript issues we solved, and lessons learned about modern web development.

Key learnings:
→ Communication is now the bottleneck, not coding
→ Your complexity budget just increased
→ Building in public builds trust

The blog is live, fully open source, and I wrote a 2000+ word deep-dive on exactly how I built it, the challenges we faced, and what this means for developers in 2026.

This is what modern development looks like. Not AI replacing developers – developers leveraging AI to ship faster and better.
